I’m a data analyst with a non-traditional path into tech—originally a cricket player,  I discovered my interest in technology through a Python programming course. I was instantly hooked by the logic and creativity of computers. I got my start through a valuable but understated company called ExploreAI, and haven’t looked back since.

Right now, in my free time I focus on exploring the end-to-end process of building AI applications and embracing the messiness of learning by doing.

I started this blog to learn—to improve how I think, write, and build. It’s a space to explore and express ideas that interest me.

If you’re curious, and coming from a path less traveled—I hope this encourages you to explore, too.
