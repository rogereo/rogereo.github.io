My journey into technology began far from a computer screen. Originally a cricket player, I learned discipline, iterative improvement, and strategy, among other habits that continue to shape how I think. A chance encounter with a Python programming course during my undergraduate degree opened me up to a new way of thinking. One built on logic, creativity, and endless possibility. 

That spark led me to ExploreAI, where I began my career in Data Science. Today, I work as a Data Analyst and spend my free time exploring the end-to-end process of building AI applications, embracing the messiness of learning in practice.

I started this blog to learn: to improve how I think, write, and build. This is where I share that journey. It’s a space to explore and express ideas that interest me. I’m learning as I go and expect to make mistakes, so I welcome feedback to help me grow.

If you come from an unconventional background or are driven by curiosity, I hope these experiments inspire you to start asking your own questions and creating, too.
